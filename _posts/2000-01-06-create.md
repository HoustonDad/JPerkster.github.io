## Create

-------------------------

#### Create your package branch

It is easiest to start this by branching a package from isv:cpanel:EA4 and immediately removing it as this will set up the build dependencies for you.

See `osc help $command` for more information on each of these commands (f.ex. `osc help mkpac`)

`osc branch isv:cpanel:EA4 scl-php71 home:$MY_USER:new_package`

`osc co home:geckmatic:new_package`

`cd home:geckmatic:new_package`

`osc delete scl-php71` 

`osc mkpac ea-php-php56-yaml`

`osc ci -m "delete this package and add the new package"`

#### Add your sources and packages
Now you can change directory into the `ea-php56-php-yaml` and add your sources and spec file.

For creating new packages we have provided a [repository](https://github.com/CpanelInc/ea4-example-specs) containing template specifications and example implementation on [GitHub](https://github.com/CpanelInc/ea4-example-specs). Editing the template file from this repo and filling in items between the `[% %]` tags should result in a building RPM. To see an example of this already completed, look at the differences between the .template file and the .spec file. For basic information on how build RPMs, please see [Maximum RPM](http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/)

1. Place the .spec file in the package directory (`home:$MY_USER:newpackage/ea-php-php56-yaml`)
2. Copy all the sources into the package directory 
  * if you just want to build the example given here, just copy the contents of the SOURCES/ from the example directory of your choice into the package directory
1. run `osc addremove .` on the package directory
2. `osc build` to test your change locally
3. `osc ci -m "First commit"` to commit to OBS

View the Project page on [Open Build Server](https://build.opensuse.org) to monitor build status or run `osc results`.
