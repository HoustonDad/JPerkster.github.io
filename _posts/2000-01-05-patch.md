## Patch

-------------------------


Patching an RPM is a reletively easy process that involves a few small updates to the SPEC (specification) file and adding the patch file to the repository.

1. Branch that package you are wanting to patch using `osc br isv:cpanel:EA4 some_package home:$MY_USER:$MY_PATCHED` and then cd into the directory with the content in it.
1. Open the .spec file in your editor of choice 
1. Update the following fields:
  * Update the number next to `release_prefix` by one. This is used to indicate the number of changes to a specific version of software
  * Add a Patch###: line with a unique patch file and number after the other Patch directives
     * example: `Patch100: foo.patch` 
  * in the %prep section, after the other %patch directives add your patch directive
     * example: `%patch 100 -p1 -b foo`
  * Add a new changelog entry in the %changelog section describing your change. See other entries for example format.
1. Copy the .patch file into the checked out directory and add it to the repository using `osc add $filename`
1. Test your change locally using `osc build`
1. Commit your changes using `osc ci -m "some message"`
