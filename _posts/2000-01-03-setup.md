## Setup

Open Build Service is used for numerous things in the EA4 stack, it is usable as both a software code repository and build system. It works via both the cli utility `osc` and via the [Open Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/) website. For most actions you will need to use both the utility and the website.

To to get started with using OBS, you will need:

1. An account on SuSE's excellent [Open Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org)
2. The 'osc' Utility
  * From your distributions package manager
    * ubuntu/debian: sudo apt-get install osc
    * Other distros, see the [OpenSuSE Tools Repository](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:/Tools/) after check your package manager for the 'osc' package.
3. run the `osc` command and input your account information
  * NOTE: this will create a file at ~/.oscrc with cleartext credentials, treat accordingly.
